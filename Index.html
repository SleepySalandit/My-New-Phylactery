        Using this, you can randomly generate a lich's phylactery for your story or Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
        Before we begin, we should answer the following question:
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1>What is a phylactery?</h1>
        <br />
        A phylactery is, broadly speaking, an item or container that a lich uses to house their soul for eternal life. As long as their phylactery or phylacteries are intact, they cannot permanently die.
        <br />
        While the Dungeons and Dragons 5e entry on the standard lich says that a phylactery must have inscriptions upon it written in silver, you are free to ignore this stipulation.
        <br />
        <br />
        With that very brief note for the uninitiated out of the way, feel free to press the button to randomly generate your phylactery!
        <br />
        Keep in mind that this is only to give ideas, you don't have to use the one generated, or even settle for just the one generated.
